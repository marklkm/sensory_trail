          <p>
            As you walk through the front gate, on your left you will find a
            small rockery and a large patch of lavender. Lavender smells the
            strongest when it is flowering in spring and summer. Are there any
            flowers on the lavender plant when you visit? Research has found
            that the smell of lavender can have calming effects on humans and
            other animals and has also been found to reduce anxiety and decrease
            stress. How are you feeling today? Do you feel any different after
            smelling lavender for a moment or two? If you like the smell, break
            a small sprig off the lavender and carry it around while you explore
            the gardens.

          <p>
            Located in a small hut in the Walled Garden, you can peep in the
            windows and watch honey bees crawling in and out their hive and
            listen to the faint buzzing. These are one of the main pollinators
            for the gardens and the reason the trees in the Gardens are so full
            of fruit every autumn. Note how you feel when you watch bees. Some
            people find watching beehives calming and hypnotic, others feel
            uncomfortable and nervous. How does watching and listening to the
            bees affect you? If you enjoy watching the bees and you are visiting
            in summer months, look for the tall plant with pale yellow flowers
            (meadow rue) by the entrance to the South Arboretum. and you should
            find it teeming with white-tailed bumble bees. Take a moment to
            watch the bees flit from flower to flower and listen to their gentle
            buzzing.

            Cycad house is filled with living fossils and some of these plants
            evolved more than 250 million years ago. How do you feel standing
            amongst plants that were a popular food with vegetarian dinosaurs?
            What does it smell like in the house? Cycads reproduce via cones
            which are either male or female, and male cones which contain the
            pollen use different scents to attract and repel pollinators. What
            does the house smell like to you on your visit? Carefully (they can
            be sharp) touch some of the leaves. Mature leaves are tough, smooth
            and often very sharp to deter herbivores. Look around and see if you
            can spot any cycads growing new leaves. What do they feel like? New
            leaves on cycads are feel much softer / velvety. This house can be
            visited all year but the greenhouse is heated in winter to protect
            these tropical trees from the cold, making it the perfect place to
            visit if the winter blues have you feeling down. You can visit the
            heated greenhouse, listen to the rain on the roof, smell the trees,
            touch the plants and enjoy some outside time in the warm.

            The Gardens contain approximately 4,000 plant species from every
            corner of the world, meaning that you do not need to travel further
            than the Gardens to meet some unusual plants you would rarely see in
            Dublin. Stove house, the long greenhouse and the cycad house contain
            tropical plants that thrive in the heat. Sensory information of
            exotic plants can invoke many feelings. If you are feeling homesick,
            you can search for familiar plants from your home country and enjoy
            looking at them, touching them or smelling them. If you are stressed
            from writing or marking essays you can wander around the exotic
            plants and reminisce about past holidays or plan your next. Missing
            your home in the countryside? Go and visit the Irish greenhouse.
            Which plants from which region are your favourite? How do they make
            you feel? If you could travel anywhere in the world, where would you
            go?

            In the Long House greenhouse you will find the collection of Aloe
            plants. One of these plants, the Aloe vera, has been designated to
            let visitors take a section of leaf from and explore the tactile
            sensory aspects of this plant. Do not take a leaf from the wrong
            aloe vera plant - if unsure always ask one of the staff! How does
            the liquid inside the leaf smell? Some describe it as a savoury
            smell, similar to garlic or an onion. Do you like the smell? Many
            people are aware that the sap inside this plant can soothe sunburn,
            but it's also a very effective moisturiser for dry skin and a
            historical treatment for acne. Some people enjoy rubbing Aloe on
            their hands as a sensory stimulant for touch and smell. Please note:
            If you decide to use this as a moisturiser / spot treatment you do
            so at your own risk, allergic reactions are possible and if you get
            aloe vera in your eye it can be very painful! So approach this
            sensory station with caution and take care of yourself.

            Herbal teas have many different flavours and tastes but they also
            have many other properties such as boosting the immune system,
            aiding digestion and hydration. Many of the plants and trees in the
            gardens have historically been used to brew different herbal teas.
            Mulberry tea for example has properties which reduce inflammation,
            regulate blood sugar and improve heart health. Tea made from pine
            needles is high in vitamins C and A which aid your immune system,
            eyesight and skin and hair regeneration. Gingko tea is high in
            antioxidants and some research shows that tea made from Gingko trees
            reduces symptoms of psychiatric disorders and dementia. Gingko tea
            may also improve brain function and reduce anxiety and / or
            depression. If you are feeling curious, there are plenty of simple
            recipes online for you to research how to brew tea from these
            plants. You are welcome to harvest a few leaves to try making your
            own tea at home.

            In the Stove House and Long House glass houses you can sometimes see
            fiddleheads growing on the ferns. These are very young fronds that
            haven't unfurled yet and they look completely different to the rest

            exceptional anti-inflammatory properties. Break off a leaf and sniff
            it. Some describe it as fresh and lemon scented. Witch hazel
            concoctions are available to purchase commercially, however if you

            The Irish House, the Long House and the Australia House are coolest
            in the summer, making them an ideal space to spend time in during
            rainy days. One plant in the Irish House, Equisetum hyemale
            (horsetail), is a living fossil which evolved tens of millions of
            years ago. Equisetum has tiny leaves that are joined at the
            colourful stripes on the stem. Take a moment and look at how
            differently shaped this plant is to many others at the gardens. Most
            plants have curves created by the stem and leaf shapes, this plant
            is linear and vertical. What do the contrasting colours remind you
            of? Stroke the stem. Does it feel rough or smooth? Does this plant
            remind you of any other plants at the Gardens? You will find tree
            stump seats in the Long House where you can sit and wait for the

            The South Arboretum is full of trees and is a cool shady spot, ideal
            for hiding from the sun on a hot summer day. If it is warm and dry
            try lying on the grass under the Black Walnut tree and looking up at
            the canopy, watching the leaves move in the wind across this sky.
            This activity can be a very grounding exercise, so if you feel like
            your head is spinning, your thoughts are racing or you are
            struggling to concentrate then it is worth trying this. When you are
            lying on the grass pay careful attention to the sensory information
            around you. What does the ground feel like on your back? Can you
            hear the birds or the leaves rustling in the breeze? What colour is

            In spring and early summer you will find wild garlic growing in the
            South Arboretum. Search for it in the spring under the trees near
            the bluebells. What does the smell remind you of? Garlic contains
            Allicin, a sulphur compound, and some find the smell relaxing and,
            whilst not proven, an old remedy for insomnia is to put a garlic
            clove under your pillow as the smell is said to relax people. Why
            not sit down on the bench in the corner of the Arboretum while you
            decide if you like the smell from the wild garlic or not? When
            picked at the right time, the entire plant is edible including the
            leaves, stalks, bulbs and flowers. Past visitors to the gardens have
            harvested this and used it in a variety of recipes including pesto,
            lasagne, and as a herb in many other recipes. As well as being a
            sensory stimulant, eating garlic has other benefits for physical
            health as it boosts the immune system and can help reduce high blood
            pressure and high cholesterol. If you catch the common cold, eating
            garlic is thought to hasten the recovery time. Visitors are allowed
            to collect wild garlic if they wish, but please note if you decide
            to consume it you do so at your own risk and it is your
            responsibility to ensure that you are not allergic and that it is
            washed and prepared correctly.

            In the east of the gardens, near Liz's bench, you will find instead
            of grass covering the ground here there is another plant, commonly
            known as Baby's tears. Soleirolia soleirolii is in the nettle family
            but it won't sting you, it is actually very soft to touch and
            cushiony to sit on. Can you see any flowers? This flowers between
            May and August but the flowers are so tiny you might not be able to
            see them. If it's a nice day, take your shoes off and walk around
            the Baby's Tears barefoot. Many people find walking outside with
            bare feet is a very grounding experience and soothes anxiety. Part
            of this is because when you are walking barefoot outside you watch
            carefully where you step meaning your eyes are absorbing a lot of
            green light waves. Green environments are soothing and research
            shows they can induce a reduction in the human heartrate which has a
            calming influence on the body. In addition to this, there are
            pressure points under your feet that connect with the eye nervous
            system, and pressure on these points can ease eyestrain. So sensory
            information received by walking around barefoot outside might
            actually improve another of your senses - eyesight.

            used to relieve traumatic injuries to the nervous system. A lectin

            being studied for its potential use against HIV. The same lectin is
            an effective insecticide against a variety of pests, including
            beetles, butterflies, moths, and aphids. Research has suggested that
            the GNA gene could be engineered into crops such as rice and
            tomatoes to increase their resistance to pests. Snowdrops should not

            change their color. As temperatures cool, some plants stop making
            chlorophyll, the green pigment found in almost all plants. It acts
            like a solar panel, capturing energy from sunlight. The cells of the
            plant then use this energy to produce sugars to feed the plant. As
            days shorten from fall into winter, there is less sunlight for the
            chlorophyll to absorb. For example, it would take too much energy
            for trees to keep their leaves healthy, so in winter, deciduous
            trees drop their leaves and go into a state of dormancy.
