              <span class="custom-bg text-white p-1">The Sensory Trail</span>
              is the work of one student's summer internship project at Trinity
              Botanic Garden to create a guide to some of the Garden's sensory
              elements for the benefit and well-being of students and staff. The
              trail currently has 18 stops: locations, plants and aspects at
              which to pause, observe and tune in to the different sensory
              elements of each. The locations of the 18 Sensory Trail stops are
              set out below on an interactive map and each has a descriptive
              text and audio guide. Visitors are invited to explore as many or
              few of the stops as they wish and in any order.
            </p>
            <p>
              The stops along the Sensory Trail cover all seasons, but some are
              only possible at particular times of the year. It may take a few
              visits to get to all of them, and because each season brings
              different sensory experiences we encourage regular visits to
              benefit from the fullest range of experiences. We will continue to
              add more stops to the Sensory Trail month by month, so please do
              check in from time to time to see what is new.
            </p>
            <p>
              As most of the Garden's spaces are outside, it is advisable to
              dress for the weather; however, the heated Stove House and Cycad
              House offer cosy respite when it is cold or wet outside.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>PLEASE NOTE</b> that most of the surfaces are a mixture of
              gravel and grass and may be more difficult to traverse for
              visitors with limited mobility. We are currently working to make
              the gardens and glasshouses easily accessible to everyone.

          <h2>Inclusive Trinity</h2>
          <p>
            In 2023 Trinity College Botanic Garden (TCBG) collaborated with
            <a

            </a>
            (opens in a new tab) on a student project to have the Garden
            included in its new map of campus: the
            <a href="https://tcdsensemap.ie/" target="_blank" rel="nonopener"
              >TCD Sense Map</a
            >
            (opens in a new tab). The map is a core element of a major
            initiative by DS,
            <a
              href="https://www.tcd.ie/disability/services/tcdsense.php"
              target="_blank"
              rel="nonopener"
              >TCD Sense - The Trinity Sensory Processing Project</a
            >
            (opens in a new tab), to make Trinity more inclusive by developing
            “different sensory environments, supports and resources to meet the
            needs of all students and staff within Trinity”. It is an
            interactive and empowering tool providing information about the
            sensory environments of different areas of the college campus, as
            well as tips on physical access, availability of power points,
            seating, and more.
          </p>

          <h2>Partnership and Possibility</h2>
          <p>
            'The Sensory Trail' is the result of the collaboration between TCBG
            and DS. The partnership enabled an additional student internship
            position at Trinity Botanic Garden to create a separate sensory map
            of the Garden, to enhance students' experience and enjoyment. Funded
            by DS and supervised by TCBG, Heather McLean who graduated from
            Botany at Trinity in 2023 was awarded the internship. While
            providing horticultural support for TCBG staff, Heather immersed
            herself in all aspects of the Garden. Identifying as neurodivergent
            herself, Heather wanted to share her experiences and to map areas,
            plants and aspects of the Garden which offer a variety of -
            sometimes novel - sensory experiences to stimulate or calm the
            senses. With additional assistance from the talented team at
            disAbility Services the Sensory Trail has been developed into a
            simple app with an audio-visual user-guide to the unique sensory
            elements of each stop.

            As well as a teaching and research facility, the Garden provides a
            unique off-campus resource of quiet, reflective space for students
            and staff to escape the busyness of campus life. We are committed to
            the principle that everyone is entitled to open space, so our gates
            are open to everyone, free of charge.

                    The Gardens are available to visit all year round, except
                    during the Christmas holiday period - opening hours are
                    listed below. Occasionally members of the public are invited
                    in for events, and details of these can be found on the
                    Calendar of Events page on the Trinity College Botanic
                    Garden website. Trinity College Dublin's Botanic Garden sits
                    on a 1.5 hectare site by Palmerston Park.

                  <p>
                    Getting to the Gardens is easy with a leap card. The 140 bus
                    runs every ten minutes from outside Trinity via Rathmines to
                    Dartry. Stay on the bus until the very last stop and the
                    Gardens are a three-minute walk away. Alternatively, take
                    the LUAS Green Line to Cowper and the Gardens are a
                    10-minute walk from there.

                  <p>
                    Catering facilities are not available at the Gardens so
                    bring your refreshments, but please take all of your rubbish
                    with you when you leave.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The Walled Garden and glasshouses are open Monday to Friday
                    from 9 am to 4 pm and accessible via the main front gate on
                    Palmerston Park, or via the rear of Trinity Hall. The West
                    and South Arboretums are accessible 24/7 (access is via
                    Trinity Hall entrance only); however, please note that any
                    planned activities in the arboretums must be notified in

                    <strong>Sensory Classification: Quiet Space.</strong> The
                    Botanic Garden is a quiet and peaceful space for the college
                    community to enjoy nature and an incredible collection of
                    plants. During term time, some areas may be slightly busy
                    when the Gardens are being used for teaching, but the
                    majority of the time, they are quiet and peaceful. Visitors
                    are welcome to walk the grounds, explore the glasshouses, or
                    rest, read, and relax with nature. Detailed sensory
                    information is included in the Sensory Trail of the
                    Gardens.<br /><br />

                    <strong>What is Sensory Processing?</strong>
                    Sensory processing is the means by which individuals obtain
                    information about the world an their own bodies. (Brown,
                    Steffen-Sanchez, Nicholson, 2019). We all have different
                    sensory needs that can change depending on neurotype, energy
                    levels, mood, context, and mechanism of perception.

                        will find a small rockery and a large patch of lavender.
                        Lavender smells the strongest when it is flowering in
                        spring and summer. Are there any flowers on the lavender
                        plant when you visit? Research has found that the smell
                        of lavender can have calming effects on humans and other
                        animals and has also been found to reduce anxiety and
                        decrease stress. How are you feeling today? Do you feel
                        any different after smelling lavender for a moment or
                        two? If you like the smell, break a small sprig off the
                        lavender and carry it around while you explore the
                        gardens.

                        should find it teeming with white-tailed bumble bees.

                        Cycad house is filled with living fossils and some of
                        these plants evolved more than 250 million years ago.
                        How do you feel standing amongst plants that were a
                        popular food with vegetarian dinosaurs? What does it
                        smell like in the house? Cycads reproduce via cones
                        which are either male or female, and male cones which
                        contain the pollen use different scents to attract and
                        repel pollinators. What does the house smell like to you
                        on your visit? Carefully (they can be sharp) touch some
                        of the leaves. Mature leaves are tough, smooth and often
                        very sharp to deter herbivores. Look around and see if
                        you can spot any cycads growing new leaves. What do they
                        feel like? New leaves on cycads are feel much softer /
                        velvety. This house can be visited all year but the
                        greenhouse is heated in winter to protect these tropical
                        trees from the cold, making it the perfect place to
                        visit if the winter blues have you feeling down. You can
                        visit the heated greenhouse, listen to the rain on the
                        roof, smell the trees, touch the plants and enjoy some
                        outside time in the warm.

                        tropical plants that thrive in the heat. Sensory
                        information of exotic plants can invoke many feelings.
                        If you are feeling homesick, you can search for familiar
                        plants from your home country and enjoy looking at them,
                        touching them or smelling them. If you are stressed from
                        writing or marking essays you can wander around the
                        exotic plants and reminisce about past holidays or plan
                        your next. Missing your home in the countryside? Go and
                        visit the Irish greenhouse. Which plants from which
                        region are your favourite? How do they make you feel? If
                        you could travel anywhere in the world, where would you
                        go?

                            Dublin. Stove house, the long greenhouse and the
                            cycad house contain tropical plants that thrive in
                            the heat. Sensory information of exotic plants can
                            invoke many feelings. If you are feeling homesick,
                            you can search for familiar plants from your home
                            country and enjoy looking at them, touching them or
                            smelling them. If you are stressed from writing or
                            marking essays you can wander around the exotic
                            plants and reminisce about past holidays or plan
                            your next. Missing your home in the countryside? Go
                            and visit the Irish greenhouse. Which plants from
                            which region are your favourite? How do they make
                            you feel? If you could travel anywhere in the world,
                            where would you go?

                        In the Long House greenhouse you will find the
                        collection of Aloe plants. One of these plants, the Aloe
                        vera, has been designated to let visitors take a section
                        of leaf from and explore the tactile sensory aspects of
                        this plant. Do not take a leaf from the wrong aloe vera
                        plant - if unsure always ask one of the staff! How does
                        the liquid inside the leaf smell? Some describe it as a
                        savoury smell, similar to garlic or an onion. Do you
                        like the smell? Many people are aware that the sap
                        inside this plant can soothe sunburn, but it's also a
                        very effective moisturiser for dry skin and a historical
                        treatment for acne. Some people enjoy rubbing Aloe on
                        their hands as a sensory stimulant for touch and smell.
                        Please note: If you decide to use this as a moisturiser
                        / spot treatment you do so at your own risk, allergic
                        reactions are possible and if you get aloe vera in your
                        eye it can be very painful! So approach this sensory

                        Herbal teas have many different flavours and tastes but
                        they also have many other properties such as boosting
                        the immune system, aiding digestion and hydration. Many
                        of the plants and trees in the gardens have historically
                        been used to brew different herbal teas. Mulberry tea
                        for example has properties which reduce inflammation,
                        regulate blood sugar and improve heart health. Tea made
                        from pine needles is high in vitamins C and A which aid
                        your immune system, eyesight and skin and hair
                        regeneration. Gingko tea is high in antioxidants and
                        some research shows that tea made from Gingko trees
                        reduces symptoms of psychiatric disorders and dementia.
                        Gingko tea may also improve brain function and reduce
                        anxiety and / or depression. If you are feeling curious,
                        there are plenty of simple recipes online for you to
                        research how to brew tea from these plants. You are
                        welcome to harvest a few leaves to try making your own
                        tea at home.

                            Herbal teas have many different flavours and tastes
                            but they also have many other properties such as
                            boosting the immune system, aiding digestion and
                            hydration. Many of the plants and trees in the
                            gardens have historically been used to brew
                            different herbal teas. Mulberry tea for example has
                            properties which reduce inflammation, regulate blood
                            sugar and improve heart health. Tea made from pine
                            needles is high in vitamins C and A which aid your
                            immune system, eyesight and skin and hair
                            regeneration. Gingko tea is high in antioxidants and
                            some research shows that tea made from Gingko trees
                            reduces symptoms of psychiatric disorders and
                            dementia. Gingko tea may also improve brain function
                            and reduce anxiety and / or depression. If you are
                            feeling curious, there are plenty of simple recipes
                            online for you to research how to brew tea from
                            these plants. You are welcome to harvest a few
                            leaves to try making your own tea at home.

                        The Irish House, the Long House and the Australia House
                        are coolest in the summer, making them an ideal space to
                        spend time in during rainy days. One plant in the Irish

                        which evolved tens of millions of years ago. Equisetum
                        has tiny leaves that are joined at the colourful stripes
                        on the stem. Take a moment and look at how differently
                        shaped this plant is to many others at the gardens. Most
                        plants have curves created by the stem and leaf shapes,
                        this plant is linear and vertical. What do the
                        contrasting colours remind you of? Stroke the stem. Does
                        it feel rough or smooth? Does this plant remind you of
                        any other plants at the Gardens? You will find tree
                        stump seats in the Long House where you can sit and wait
                        for the storm to pass while you smell the rain and
                        listen to the sound on the roof.

                        The South Arboretum is full of trees and is a cool shady
                        spot, ideal for hiding from the sun on a hot summer day.
                        If it is warm and dry try lying on the grass under the
                        Black Walnut tree and looking up at the canopy, watching
                        the leaves move in the wind across this sky. This
                        activity can be a very grounding exercise, so if you
                        feel like your head is spinning, your thoughts are
                        racing or you are struggling to concentrate then it is
                        worth trying this. When you are lying on the grass pay
                        careful attention to the sensory information around you.
                        What does the ground feel like on your back? Can you
                        hear the birds or the leaves rustling in the breeze?
                        What colour is the sky today? Can you smell the wild
                        garlic?

                            The South Arboretum is full of trees and is a cool
                            shady spot, ideal for hiding from the sun on a hot
                            summer day. If it is warm and dry try lying on the
                            grass under the Black Walnut tree and looking up at
                            the canopy, watching the leaves move in the wind
                            across this sky. This activity can be a very
                            grounding exercise, so if you feel like your head is
                            spinning, your thoughts are racing or you are
                            struggling to concentrate then it is worth trying
                            this. When you are lying on the grass pay careful
                            attention to the sensory information around you.
                            What does the ground feel like on your back? Can you
                            hear the birds or the leaves rustling in the breeze?
                            What colour is the sky today? Can you smell the wild
                            garlic?

                        In spring and early summer you will find wild garlic
                        growing in the South Arboretum. Search for it in the
                        spring under the trees near the bluebells. What does the
                        smell remind you of? Garlic contains Allicin, a sulphur
                        compound, and some find the smell relaxing and, whilst
                        not proven, an old remedy for insomnia is to put a
                        garlic clove under your pillow as the smell is said to
                        relax people. Why not sit down on the bench in the
                        corner of the Arboretum while you decide if you like the
                        smell from the wild garlic or not? When picked at the
                        right time, the entire plant is edible including the
                        leaves, stalks, bulbs and flowers. Past visitors to the
                        gardens have harvested this and used it in a variety of
                        recipes including pesto, lasagne, and as a herb in many
                        other recipes. As well as being a sensory stimulant,
                        eating garlic has other benefits for physical health as
                        it boosts the immune system and can help reduce high
                        blood pressure and high cholesterol. If you catch the
                        common cold, eating garlic is thought to hasten the
                        recovery time. Visitors are allowed to collect wild
                        garlic if they wish, but please note if you decide to
                        consume it you do so at your own risk and it is your
                        responsibility to ensure that you are not allergic and
                        that it is washed and prepared correctly.

                        Dotted around the lawn are fruit trees including a pear
                        tree and two apple trees, one which produces exceptional
                        eating apples, and the other exceptional cooking apples.
                        In the spring these trees are filled with fragrant
                        blossom, in the summer you can see baby apples beginning
                        to grow and in the autumn the trees are full of fruit.
                        We encourage you to visit these trees and engage with
                        the visual and scented stimuli they provide across the
                        seasons. No one will stop you harvesting fruit from
                        these trees, stewed apples and poached pears are a
                        delicious way to incorporate vitamin C and healthy fibre
                        into your diet. Foraging local apples and pears has many
                        benefits, both for individuals and the environment, but
                        any food gathered is consumed at your own risk. Wash
                        everything thoroughly before eating and do not consume
                        anything unless you are 100% sure the fruit is edible.

                        In the east of the gardens, near Liz's bench, you will
                        find instead of grass covering the ground here there is
                        another plant, commonly known as Baby's tears.
                        Soleirolia soleirolii is in the nettle family but it
                        won't sting you, it is actually very soft to touch and
                        cushiony to sit on. Can you see any flowers? This
                        flowers between May and August but the flowers are so
                        tiny you might not be able to see them. If it's a nice
                        day, take your shoes off and walk around the Baby's
                        Tears barefoot. Many people find walking outside with
                        bare feet is a very grounding experience and soothes
                        anxiety. Part of this is because when you are walking
                        barefoot outside you watch carefully where you step
                        meaning your eyes are absorbing a lot of green light
                        waves. Green environments are soothing and research
                        shows they can induce a reduction in the human heartrate
                        which has a calming influence on the body. In addition
                        to this, there are pressure points under your feet that
                        connect with the eye nervous system, and pressure on
                        these points can ease eyestrain. So sensory information
                        received by walking around barefoot outside might
                        actually improve another of your senses - eyesight.

                        Snowdrops contain a compound called galanthamine which
                        is used in modern pharmaceuticals to manage Alzheimer's
                        disease and is also used to relieve traumatic injuries
                        to the nervous system. A lectin (carbohydrate-binding
                        protein) in common snowdrops called GNA is being studied
                        for its potential use against HIV. The same lectin is an
                        effective insecticide against a variety of pests,
                        including beetles, butterflies, moths, and aphids.
                        Research has suggested that the GNA gene could be
                        engineered into crops such as rice and tomatoes to
                        increase their resistance to pests. Snowdrops should not
                        be eaten as they contain a poisonous compound, lycorine,
                        which can cause diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting.

                        While enjoying the colors, some may not know exactly why
                        the leaves change their color. As temperatures cool,
                        some plants stop making chlorophyll, the green pigment
                        found in almost all plants. It acts like a solar panel,
                        capturing energy from sunlight. The cells of the plant
                        then use this energy to produce sugars to feed the
                        plant. As days shorten from fall into winter, there is
                        less sunlight for the chlorophyll to absorb. For
                        example, it would take too much energy for trees to keep
                        their leaves healthy, so in winter, deciduous trees drop
                        their leaves and go into a state of dormancy.
