          <p>
            <span class="bg-danger text-white p-1">The Sensory Trail</span> is the work of one student's summer internship
            project at Trinity Botanic Garden to create a guide to some of the
            Garden's sensory elements for the benefit and well-being of students
            and staff. The trail currently has 18 stops: locations, plants and
            aspects at which to pause, observe and tune in to the different
            sensory elements of each. The locations of the 18 Sensory Trail
            stops are set out below on an interactive map and each has a
            descriptive text and audio guide. Visitors are invited to explore as
            many or few of the stops as they wish and in any order.
          </p>
          <p>
            The stops along the Sensory Trail cover all seasons, but some are
            only possible at particular times of the year. It may take a few
            visits to get to all of them, and because each season brings
            different sensory experiences we encourage regular visits to benefit
            from the fullest range of experiences. We will continue to add more
            stops to the Sensory Trail month by month, so please do check in
            from time to time to see what is new.
          </p>
          <p>
            As most of the Garden's spaces are outside, it is advisable to dress
            for the weather; however, the heated Stove House and Cycad House
            offer cosy respite when it is cold or wet outside.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>PLEASE NOTE</b> that most of the surfaces are a mixture of gravel
            and grass and may be more difficult to traverse for visitors with
            limited mobility. We are currently working to make the gardens and
            glasshouses easily accessible to everyone.

        <h3>Inclusive Trinity</h3>
        <p>
          In 2023 Trinity College Botanic Garden (TCBG) collaborated with
          <a
            href="https://www.tcd.ie/disability/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="nonopener"
          >
            Trinity disAbility Service
          </a>
          (opens in a new tab) on a student project to have the Garden included
          in its new map of campus: the
          <a href="https://tcdsensemap.ie/" target="_blank" rel="nonopener"
            >TCD Sense Map</a
          >
          (opens in a new tab). The map is a core element of a major initiative
          by DS,
          <a
            href="https://www.tcd.ie/disability/services/tcdsense.php"
            target="_blank"
            rel="nonopener"
            >TCD Sense - The Trinity Sensory Processing Project</a
          >
          (opens in a new tab), to make Trinity more inclusive by developing
          “different sensory environments, supports and resources to meet the
          needs of all students and staff within Trinity”. It is an interactive
          and empowering tool providing information about the sensory
          environments of different areas of the college campus, as well as tips
          on physical access, availability of power points, seating, and more.
        </p>

        <h3>Partnership and possibility</h3>
        <p>
          'The Sensory Trail' is the result of the collaboration between TCBG
          and DS. The partnership enabled an additional student internship
          position at Trinity Botanic Garden to create a separate sensory map of
          the Garden, to enhance students' experience and enjoyment. Funded by
          DS and supervised by TCBG, Heather McLean who graduated from Botany at
          Trinity in 2023 was awarded the internship. While providing
          horticultural support for TCBG staff, Heather immersed herself in all
          aspects of the Garden. Identifying as neurodivergent herself, Heather
          wanted to share her experiences and to map areas, plants and aspects
          of the Garden which offer a variety of - sometimes novel - sensory
          experiences to stimulate or calm the senses. With additional
          assistance from the talented team at disAbility Services the Sensory
          Trail has been developed into a simple app with an audio-visual
          user-guide to the unique sensory elements of each stop.
        </p>
        <p>
          Trinity College Botanic Garden is located behind Trinity Hall student
          residences in Dartry and is now included in the
          <a href="https://tcdsensemap.ie/" target="_blank" rel="nonopener"
            >TCD Sense Map </a
          >(opens in a new tab). As well as a teaching and research facility,
          the Garden provides a unique off-campus resource of quiet, reflective
          space for students and staff to escape the busyness of campus life.
        </p>

        <p>
          We hope everyone will enjoy the many sensory experiences offered in
          Trinity's private garden space.
        </p>

                  <p>The Gardens are available to visit all year round, except
                  during the Christmas holiday period - opening hours are listed
                  below. Occasionally members of the public are invited in for
                  events, and details of these can be found on the Calendar of
                  Events page on the Trinity College Botanic Garden website. Trinity College Dublin's 
                  Botanic Garden sits on a 1.5 hectare site by Palmerston Park.

                  Getting to the Gardens is easy with a leap card. The 140 bus
                  runs every ten minutes from outside Trinity via Rathmines to
                  Dartry. Stay on the bus until the very last stop and the
                  Gardens are a three-minute walk away. Alternatively, take the
                  LUAS Green Line to Cowper and the Gardens are a 10-minute walk
                  from there.

                <strong>Sensory Classification: Quiet Space.</strong> The Botanic Garden is a quiet and 
                peaceful space for the college community to enjoy nature and an incredible collection of plants. During term time, 
                some areas may be slightly busy when the Gardens are being used for teaching, but the majority of the time, they are
                 quiet and peaceful. Visitors are welcome to walk the grounds, explore the glasshouses, or rest, read, and relax with nature. 
                 Detailed sensory information is included in the Sensory Trail of the Gardens.

                      As you walk through the front gate, on your left you will
                      find a small rockery and a large patch of lavender.
                      Lavender smells the strongest when it is flowering in
                      spring and summer. Are there any flowers on the lavender
                      plant when you visit? Research has found that the smell of
                      lavender can have calming effects on humans and other
                      animals and has also been found to reduce anxiety and
                      decrease stress. How are you feeling today? Do you feel
                      any different after smelling lavender for a moment or two?
                      If you like the smell, break a small sprig off the
                      lavender and carry it round with you while you explore the
                      gardens.

                      Located in a small hut in the Walled Garden, you can peep in the windows and watch honey bees
                      crawling in and out their hive and listen to the faint
                      buzzing. These are one of the main pollinators for the
                      gardens and the reason the trees in the Gardens are so
                      full of fruit every autumn. Note how you feel when you
                      watch bees. Some people find watching beehives calming and
                      hypnotic, others feel uncomfortable and nervous. How does
                      watching and listening to the bees affect you? If you
                      enjoy watching the bees and you are visiting in summer
                      months, look for the tall plant with pale yellow flowers
                      (meadow rue) by the entrance to the South Arboretum. and
                      you should find it teeming with white-tailed bumble bees.
                      Take a moment to watch the bees flit from flower to flower
                      and listen to their gentle buzzing.

                    <p>
                      Cycad house is filled with living fossils and some of
                      these plants evolved more than 250 million years ago. How
                      do you feel standing amongst plants that were a popular
                      food with vegetarian dinosaurs? What does it smell like in
                      the house? Cycads reproduce via cones which are either
                      male or female, and male cones which contain the pollen
                      use different scents to attract and repel pollinators.
                      What does the house smell like to you on your visit?
                      Carefully (they can be sharp) touch some of the leaves.
                      Mature leaves are tough, smooth and often very sharp to
                      deter herbivores. Look around and see if you can spot any
                      cycads growing new leaves. What do they feel like? New
                      leaves on cycads are feel much softer / velvety. This
                      house can be visited all year but the greenhouse is heated
                      in winter to protect these tropical trees from the cold,
                      making it the perfect place to visit if the winter blues
                      have you feeling down. You can visit the heated
                      greenhouse, listen to the rain on the roof, smell the
                      trees, touch the plants and enjoy some outside time in the
                      warm.

                      The Gardens contain approximately 4,000 plant species from
                      every corner of the world, meaning that you do not need to
                      travel further than the Gardens to meet some unusual
                      plants you would rarely see in Dublin. Stove house, the
                      long greenhouse and the cycad house contain tropical
                      plants that thrive in the heat. Sensory information of
                      exotic plants can invoke many feelings. If you are feeling
                      homesick, you can search for familiar plants from your
                      home country and enjoy looking at them, touching them or
                      smelling them. If you are stressed from writing or marking
                      essays you can wander around the exotic plants and
                      reminisce about past holidays or plan your next. Missing
                      your home in the countryside? Go and visit the Irish
                      greenhouse. Which plants from which region are your
                      favourite? How do they make you feel? If you could travel
                      anywhere in the world, where would you go?

                      In the Long House greenhouse you will find the collection
                      of Aloe plants. One of these plants, the Aloe vera, has
                      been designated to let visitors take a section of leaf
                      from and explore the tactile sensory aspects of this
                      plant. Do not take a leaf from the wrong aloe vera plant –
                      if unsure always ask one of the staff! How does the liquid
                      inside the leaf smell? Some describe it as a savoury
                      smell, similar to garlic or an onion. Do you like the
                      smell? Many people are aware that the sap inside this
                      plant can soothe sunburn, but it’s also a very effective
                      moisturiser for dry skin and a historical treatment for
                      acne. Some people enjoy rubbing Aloe on their hands as a
                      sensory stimulant for touch and smell. Please note: If you
                      decide to use this as a moisturiser / spot treatment you
                      do so at your own risk, allergic reactions are possible
                      and if you get aloe vera in your eye it can be very
                      painful! So approach this sensory station with caution and
                      take care of yourself.

                      Herbal teas have many different flavours and tastes but
                      they also have many other properties such as boosting the
                      immune system, aiding digestion and hydration. Many of the
                      plants and trees in the gardens have historically been
                      used to brew different herbal teas. Mulberry tea for
                      example has properties which reduce inflammation, regulate
                      blood sugar and improve heart health. Tea made from pine
                      needles is high in vitamins C and A which aid your immune
                      system, eyesight and skin and hair regeneration. Gingko
                      tea is high in antioxidants and some research shows that
                      tea made from Gingko trees reduces symptoms of psychiatric
                      disorders and dementia. Gingko tea may also improve brain
                      function and reduce anxiety and / or depression. If you
                      are feeling curious, there are plenty of simple recipes
                      online for you to research how to brew tea from these
                      plants. You are welcome to harvest a few leaves to try
                      making your own tea at home.

                      In the Stove House and Long House glass houses you can
                      sometimes see fiddleheads growing on the ferns. These are
                      very young fronds that haven't unfurled yet and they look
                      completely different to the rest of the plant. What do
                      they remind you of? How do they feel to touch?

                      Catnip is not just for cats. While it won't have the same
                      psychological effects on humans as it does on cats, it has
                      a unique minty smell and pretty purple flowers in summer.
                      Catnip and Lavender belong to the same family but they
                      smell different. Do you like the smell? Rub some leaves
                      between your fingers - can you tell the difference between
                      lavender and catnip by smell alone?

                      Chimonanthus praecox (wintersweet) flowers in January and
                      February. Look out for the pretty yellow flowers blooming
                      on the tree near the Irish House in the middle of winter.
                      The flowers smell quite strongly, so you are likely to
                      smell it before you see it! What do they smell like to
                      you?

                      Throughout history witch hazel has been used as a
                      treatment for many skin conditions such as stretch marks
                      and acne, due to its exceptional anti-inflammatory
                      properties. Break off a leaf and sniff it. Some describe
                      it as fresh and lemon scented. Witch hazel concoctions are
                      available to purchase commercially, however if you are
                      unable to afford it, you can research online how to forage
                      and prepare acne treatments from witch hazel you have
                      foraged yourself.

                    <p>
                      The Irish House, the Long House and the Australia House
                      are coolest in the summer, making them an ideal space to
                      spend time in during rainy days. One plant in the Irish
                      House, Equisetum hyemale (horsetail), is a living fossil
                      which evolved tens of millions of years ago. Equisetum has
                      tiny leaves that are joined at the colourful stripes on
                      the stem. Take a moment and look at how differently shaped
                      this plant is to many others at the gardens. Most plants
                      have curves created by the stem and leaf shapes, this
                      plant is linear and vertical. What do the contrasting
                      colours remind you of? Stroke the stem. Does it feel rough
                      or smooth? Does this plant remind you of any other plants
                      at the Gardens? You will find tree stump seats in the Long
                      House where you can sit and wait for the storm to pass
                      while you smell the rain and listen to the sound on the
                      roof.

                    <p>
                      The South Arboretum is full of trees and is a cool shady
                      spot, ideal for hiding from the sun on a hot summer day.
                      If it is warm and dry try lying on the grass under the
                      Black Walnut tree and looking up at the canopy, watching
                      the leaves move in the wind across this sky. This activity
                      can be a very grounding exercise, so if you feel like your
                      head is spinning, your thoughts are racing or you are
                      struggling to concentrate then it is worth trying this.
                      When you are lying on the grass pay careful attention to
                      the sensory information around you. What does the ground
                      feel like on your back? Can you hear the birds or the
                      leaves rustling in the breeze? What colour is the sky
                      today? Can you smell the wild garlic?

                    <p>
                      In spring and early summer you will find wild garlic
                      growing in the South Arboretum. Search for it in the
                      spring under the trees near the bluebells. What does the
                      smell remind you of? Garlic contains Allicin, a sulphur
                      compound, and some find the smell relaxing and, whilst not
                      proven, an old remedy for insomnia is to put a garlic
                      clove under your pillow as the smell is said to relax
                      people. Why not sit down on the bench in the corner of the
                      Arboretum while you decide if you like the smell from the
                      wild garlic or not? When picked at the right time, the
                      entire plant is edible including the leaves, stalks, bulbs
                      and flowers. Past visitors to the gardens have harvested
                      this and used it in a variety of recipes including pesto,
                      lasagne, and as a herb in many other recipes. As well as
                      being a sensory stimulant, eating garlic has other
                      benefits for physical health as it boosts the immune
                      system and can help reduce high blood pressure and high
                      cholesterol. If you catch the common cold, eating garlic
                      is thought to hasten the recovery time. Visitors are
                      allowed to collect wild garlic if they wish, but please
                      note if you decide to consume it you do so at your own
                      risk and it is your responsibility to ensure that you are
                      not allergic and that it is washed and prepared correctly.

                      Dotted around the lawn are fruit trees including a pear
                      tree and two apple trees, one which produces exceptional
                      eating apples, and the other exceptional cooking apples.
                      In the spring these trees are filled with fragrant
                      blossom, in the summer you can see baby apples beginning
                      to grow and in the autumn the trees are full of fruit. We
                      encourage you to visit these trees and engage with the
                      visual and scented stimuli they provide across the
                      seasons. No one will stop you harvesting fruit from these
                      trees, stewed apples and poached pears are a delicious way
                      to incorporate vitamin C and healthy fibre into your diet.
                      Foraging local apples and pears has many benefits, both
                      for individuals and the environment, but any food gathered
                      is consumed at your own risk. Wash everything thoroughly
                      before eating and do not consume anything unless you are
                      100% sure the fruit is edible. TCD is not liable for any
                      adverse effects from eating fruit grown at the Gardens.

                    <p>
                      In the east of the gardens, near Liz's bench, you will
                      find instead of grass covering the ground here there is
                      another plant, commonly known as Baby's tears. Soleirolia
                      soleirolii is in the nettle family but it won't sting you,
                      it is actually very soft to touch and cushiony to sit on.
                      Can you see any flowers? This flowers between May and
                      August but the flowers are so tiny you might not be able
                      to see them. If it's a nice day, take your shoes off and
                      walk around the Baby's Tears barefoot. Many people find
                      walking outside with bare feet is a very grounding
                      experience and soothes anxiety. Part of this is because
                      when you are walking barefoot outside you watch carefully
                      where you step meaning your eyes are absorbing a lot of
                      green light waves. Green environments are soothing and
                      research shows they can induce a reduction in the human
                      heartrate which has a calming influence on the body. In
                      addition to this, there are pressure points under your
                      feet that connect with the eye nervous system, and
                      pressure on these points can ease eyestrain. So sensory
                      information received by walking around barefoot outside
                      might actually improve another of your senses - eyesight.

                    <p>
                      Snowdrops contain a compound called galanthamine which is
                      used in modern pharmaceuticals to manage Alzheimer’s
                      disease and is also used to relieve traumatic injuries to
                      the nervous system. A lectin (carbohydrate-binding
                      protein) in common snowdrops called GNA is being studied
                      for its potential use against HIV. The same lectin is an
                      effective insecticide against a variety of pests,
                      including beetles, butterflies, moths, and aphids.
                      Research has suggested that the GNA gene could be
                      engineered into crops such as rice and tomatoes to
                      increase their resistance to pests. Snowdrops should not
                      be eaten as they contain a poisonous compound, lycorine,
                      which can cause diarrhoea, nausea, and vomiting.

                      While enjoying the colors, some may not know exactly why
                      the leaves change their color. As temperatures cool, some
                      plants stop making chlorophyll, the green pigment found in
                      almost all plants. It acts like a solar panel, capturing
                      energy from sunlight. The cells of the plant then use this
                      energy to produce sugars to feed the plant. As days
                      shorten from fall into winter, there is less sunlight for
                      the chlorophyll to absorb. For example, it would take too
                      much energy for trees to keep their leaves healthy, so in
                      winter, deciduous trees drop their leaves and go into a
                      state of dormancy.
